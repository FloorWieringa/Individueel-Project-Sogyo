## Description
This is an escape room implementation, where the goal of the game is to escape with all the necessary information and your life intact. You can achieve this by interacting with the items in the room, by taking items and using them on other items, and by solving riddles. There are several puzzle loops, all of which need to be solved in order to finish the game.

## Visuals
![A visual representation of the room](https://i.imgur.com/8yHXfHD.png)

Above is a visual example of the room. The first line is the last part of the explanatory intro text. The white text is the explanation triggered by clicking somewhere in the room (in this case, the robot hand). The inventory at the bottom currently contains only a piece of wire, which can be used on the robot hand by clicking _Use item from inventory_ beneath the white text, and selecting _Wire_ from the list that appeared.

## Installation
This project uses a Gradle wrapper and currently runs the front-end using Node JS. In order to start the application, open Git Bash (or similar, but then please figure out how to translate the commands as well) in the client folder, and run _npm run build_. Then go back to the main folder, open another instance of Bash and run _./gradlew build run_. The application will open automatically. 

## Usage
Itâ€™s a game. You can play it.

## Support
